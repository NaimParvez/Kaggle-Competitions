# Kaggle-Competitions 🏆

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my work on various **Kaggle competitions**.  
Each folder corresponds to a specific competition and includes my solution notebooks, datasets, and prediction files.

The purpose of this repo is to:
- Document my learning and participation in Kaggle challenges
- Showcase different approaches to solving real-world machine learning problems
- Track my progress and improvements across competitions
